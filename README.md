DESCRIPTION :

This is a simple rule-based AI chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with the help of the nltk library in Python.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Recognizes user input based on pre-defined intent templates

Uses tokenization and lemmatization for input processing

Matches user queries to appropriate intents like greetings, farewells, name queries, thanks, help, and weather-related questions

Responds with randomly selected pre-defined reactions

Designed with a clean, simple conversation loop

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:

Python

NLTK (punkt, wordnet, WordNetLemmatizer)

ðŸ”¹ How it works:

User input is preprocessed (converted to lowercase, cleaned, and lemmatized).

The chatbot tries to match the input to an intent by comparing token patterns.

If a match is found, it returns a relevant response. If not, it gives a fallback message.
